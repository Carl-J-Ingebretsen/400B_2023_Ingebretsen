ASTR400B Homework 7 Answers

1) Plots are attached as separate files.

2) The trajectories from the last homework have many more oscillations. The calculated trajectory from this homework has only one hump.

3) We made the assumption the M33 is a point mass. Since it is an extended mass it will be deformed and orbit differently. We also did not take into account the acceleration due to the Milky Way's gravity.

4)Using the properties of the Milky Way from the simulation we could calculate the acceleration with a similar function to what we've coded.
